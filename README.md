# Libraries.Auth.Microsoft.Sample
Sample WPF app to test [`Libraries.Auth.Microsoft`](https://github.com/HunLuxLauncher/Libraries.Auth.Microsoft).

> **IMPORTANT!**
> All of HunLuxLauncher's projects **require** CzompiSoftware's NuGet server (because most of the packages are from there), so you need to add a NuGet repository to your VS or download [this NuGet.config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CzompiSoftware/SampleProject/master/nuget.config) file and place it next to your .sln file.
> If you'd like to manually add CzompiSoftware's NuGet server, then add the following url to your `Visual Studio` or `NuGet.config` file:
> ```
> https://nuget.czompisoftware.hu/v3/index.json
> ```
